## VBA Scripting

Created a VBA script that loops through all the stocks for each year and provides the following information and results:
* Ticker symbol
* Yearly change for each stock that caluclates the difference between the closing price at the end of the year and the opening price at the beginning of the year
* Percent change for each stock that calculates the percent difference between the closing price at the end of the year and the opening price at the beginning of the year
* Total volume of each stock
* Additional metrics for each year: 
  - Ticker symbol with the greatest percent increase
  - Ticker symbol with the greatest percent decrease
  - Ticker symbol with the greatest total volume

Features:
* Highlighted (fill and text) result rows based on positive or negative change
* Auto-fit columns
